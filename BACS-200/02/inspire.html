            What makes a hero?  A hero is someone that we look up to.
            Heroes embody what we truly value most.  Therefore who we select as
            role models says a lot about who we are as people.
        </p>
        <p>
            The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Outrageously courageous - they disturb the status quo and define a new normal</li>
            <li>Motivate others - people follow a great leader</li>
            <li>Big footprint - impact on millions and change the world</li>
            <li>Sacrifice & commitment - their impact usually costs them everything</li>
            <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
        </ul>

            Not only has my grandfather inspired me, he has inspired thousands of people through his family carreer and life.  He helped create the F22 jet fighter and and other various radio systems for northworth grumman.  Before my grandfather created the F22, he went to school in the 70s while married to my grandmother who at the time was rasing their oldest daughter my mother. through hard times and low income, my gradnfather persoviered and never gave up.
