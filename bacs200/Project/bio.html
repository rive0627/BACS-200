            Growing up, my father was always painting. In California he worked at the Art Department for SeaWorld where he painted, sculpted various art projects. When my family moved to Colorado my father started selling different paintings on eBay. Always being surrounded by this art, I found myself drawing since I was born.

        <p>When I was nine, I became very proficient at painting birds. As I grew up, I started to expand to different types of drawing and paintings. When I started high school, I began taking art classes that taught all levels and covered sculpting, painting and more. Every year this class had art competition, and while I was there I one every category of art available at the school. It was at this time I realized I was talented at art. It came easily and I loved doing it. Little did I know my art would carry me to where I am today,
